# DDA_CGAVR
This program implements the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm using OpenGL to draw a line between two user-provided points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
It calculates the small stepwise increments in x and y based on the slope of the line and plots individual pixels to form a straight line.
